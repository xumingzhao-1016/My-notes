Table: Delivery

+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.

The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the **percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers（在第一笔订单中immediate的比例）**, rounded to 2 decimal places.

解法一：
```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 
    / COUNT(*), 2
) AS immediate_percentage
FROM Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id -- WHERE + 子查询不用给表起别名
);
```
解法二（窗口函数）：
```sql
SELECT ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 
    / COUNT(*), 2
) AS immediate_percentage
FROM (SELECT (*),
                ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS rn
      FROM Delivery
) AS sub -- FROM + 子查询要起别名
WHERE rn = 1

## 配对计算值
Table: Activity

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
It is guaranteed that each (machine_id, process_id) pair has a 'start' and 'end' timestamp.
 

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.
``` sql
SELECT machine_id, ROUND(AVG(start_time-end_time,3) AS processing_time
FROM（
      SELECT machine_id,
             process_id,
             MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start', then timestamp END) AS start_time
             MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end', then timestamp END) AS end_time -- start & end 分别提取出来
       FROM Activity

) AS sub

## 按条件统计
Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

```sql
SELECT query_name,
       ROUND(AVG(rating/position),2) AS quality
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE O END) *100.0/COUNT(*),2) AS poor_query_percentage
-- 按条件筛选出来进行统计
FROM Queries
GROUP BY query_name
```

| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some games.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
 

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

      FROM Events
      ) AS a
GROUP BY status, group_id
ORDER BY start_id
```
**减差法** - 对于一个连续的相同值序列，它的id和row_number的差值是固定的，可以用这个差值来标记“当前这段连续块”
